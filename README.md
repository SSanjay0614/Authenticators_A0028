# Drug Forge: AI/ML-Driven Drug Discovery Platform

## Problem Statement
Drug discovery is a long and expensive process, involving many trial-and-error experiments to assess the properties of potential drug molecules. Traditional approaches require manual testing of ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties, drug-target binding, and molecular interactions, which can take years and cost billions of dollars. The lack of predictive tools adds to this challenge, making the early stages of drug development highly inefficient.

## Solution
**Drug Forge** is a machine learning-powered web platform that accelerates drug discovery by providing key insights into the properties of molecules, without the need for manual assays. Our platform enables scientists to predict crucial drug features like ADMET properties, drug-target binding scores, and activity against specific biological targets.
