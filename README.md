Drug Forge
Problem Statement
Drug discovery is a long, complex, and costly process involving various stages, from identifying potential drug targets to testing for safety and efficacy. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual testing, trial-and-error approaches, and the development of assays for drug properties like solubility, toxicity, and molecular binding. This slows down the process, increases costs, and may not cover all potential drug candidates efficiently.

Solution
Drug Forge aims to accelerate and optimize the drug discovery process by leveraging AI/ML models to predict critical drug properties in silico, reducing the need for manual experimentation. Our platform provides scientists and researchers with powerful tools to predict key features like ADMET properties, drug-target interactions, and molecular docking scores. These predictions streamline decision-making, reducing both time and cost during the early stages of drug development.
